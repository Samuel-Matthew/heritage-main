# Heriglob Trade Hub (local development)

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffolded with shadcn-ui and Tailwind.

Quick start (local):

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\your\project"
npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

If your project path contains spaces (e.g. "Heritage oil & gas"), run Vite directly to avoid path resolution issues:

```powershell
node "node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js"
```

Or use the npm script:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Notes:
- This repository no longer uses any external Lovable tooling. All code is intended to be edited locally with your preferred editor.
- If you want a simpler structure or help removing additional tooling, tell me which parts you'd like simplified and I can refactor them.
